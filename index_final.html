        <p class="p1testimonial">“What can I say?  The Graphic Arts departments is one of the best departments on the RVC Campus.  The professors are wonderful.  My classmates have been very wonderful and helpful to me to understand what I must do”  Mark<br><br>
        “It has been a truly invaluable learning experience for me. I want you to know that I have learnt so much from all of your constructive input and guidance throughout each lesson of the course. You have helped me to understand where my strengths and weaker aspects lie, and what areas of my answering questions I need to pay attention to.<br>
        Thank you for getting my assignments back to me as promptly as you have, and thank you for making this course so enjoyable.” Janelle<br><br>
        “I have really improved my knowledge in this field.  It has also given me the confidence to start my own small business in private Graphic Arts.” Megatron<br><br>
        "I am currently studying the Wildlife Management certificate course and am thoroughly enjoying myself!  I have studied online before but have found that ACS provides a much greater level of support than other institutions.  I have also found the courses to be much more in-depth than I thought they would be, and feel that I'm really getting value for money.  I've found the modules I've already completed in environmental assessment, ecology, ornithology and marine studies to be very relevant to my "work" as a wildlife rehabilitator and the knowledge I've gained has given me a greater understanding of the pressures that our native wildlife faces.  I'm also sure that this course of study has been an influencing factor in getting my dream job - working with endangered big cat species in South Africa. <strong>Wait, am I reviewing the right course?</strong>" Godzilla

       <h3>Mass Communication Student Testimonials</h3>
        <p class=p2testimonial>
           “The notes and study tools encourage me to conduct research to develop my knowledge of components in my course. It is very worthwhile. Mr. LaBuy gives me good feedback and food for thought with his comments and sometimes elaborates on my answers - really value his input.”  LaRissa<br><br>
           “Mass Comm gave me extra knowledge of the industry that I am currently working in. It covered all aspects of the industry. I liked the way you had to work through each lesson/category I received excellent feedback from my instructor. I enjoyed the Introduction to Audio course, it has given me extra knowledge that I will use.” Stephanie<br><br>
           “ This course has just helped me get a job as a proof reader! At last I have found my dream job! I have read so many books on finding the perfect career, and then, advertised in the local paper, in between 'cleaner available' and 'care assistants wanted' was my job, 'proof reader required'. The work was for a national newspaper and they were looking for someone with a high level of literacy, an interest in farming and an eye for detail. In addition to my Freelance Writing course with ACS, I have a degree in law, a small holding, and I can pick nits till the cows come home; perfect! I couldn't believe my luck; someone was actually going to pay me to read the newspaper. The work was part time and so flexible I could even bring it home with me. My imagination worked overtime; I was already laid back in my hammock casually marking out mistakes with a glass of something cold and fizzy by my side.<br>
           Of course, in reality it is nothing like that; proof reading requires intense concentration and the ability to read very fast while picking out a variety of errors. The newspaper is a farming publication and while many articles are interesting, the technical subjects are hard work. One thing the job has taught me though, is that some writers are a lot better than others. If you know your subject well and are reliable, just about anyone can get published.” Robin Hood

            <div><p>Students in the program are prepared for a variety of jobs in the printing and publishing industry and related fields of graphic arts. The graphic arts industry is a major employer in Illinois and according to the Printing Industry of Illinois/Indiana, in the metro Chicago area. The Graphic Arts Technology Program focuses on developing students with a well-rounded education encompassing both the creative and technical aspects of the industry with a focus on the digital production techniques that are changing the world of media delivery.<br><br><strong>Option A - </strong>Practical learning experiences are offered in areas of design, layout and typography, production processes, variable data manipulation, estimating, and screen printing. Students gain in-depth experience working with text and images, page layout, specifying paper and ink selection, process color, and Pantone spot colors, job estimating and business practices, and offset press operation, as well as binding and finishing choices.<br><strong>Option B - </strong>In the Graphic Design Program, you will study the concepts of drawing and design, typography, color theory, print processes, digital photography, illustration, page layout, marketing and advertising. In addition, you will learn to work within budget and time constraints, prepare electronic files for printing, choose appropriate printing and paper supplies, interpret and evaluate criticism of design and present a creative rationale to a client.<br><strong>Option C - </strong>The current trend in printing and publishing companies across the nation is to integrate the use of the one-dimensional medium of print with other multi-dimensional forms of communication. The Cross Media Production course of study involves not only developing graphics and publishing pieces, but also web and television design.</p></div>
